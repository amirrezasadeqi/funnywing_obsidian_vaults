This first thing that I've founde about the connection of __9XTend__ is that we need to use the module that Mr.Rezvani developed to be able to communication the data with the Computer. From Computer I mean PC or raspberry pi board.

I have tried to connect the RF module to raspberry pi directly with the pi pinout but I could not receive the data comming from the mate module which is connected into pixhawk board. On the other hand when we use the Mr.Rezvani usb module the data nicely transfers even with raspberry pi board and we can infer that the power supply is not a problem.

So as I understood the problem is about the protocol of connection. consequently, I tested this connection with __PL2303__ module which we had bought in our shoppings. but it does not work. I will test this module more in next tries.
