[related stack question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30306799/droneapi-and-custom-mavlink-message) : a little old. I think you should test the `Vehicle.send_mavlink` for sending custom messages!
[`send_mavlink API reference`](https://dronekit-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/automodule.html) : search send_mavlink in this page.
[how to send a mavlink messages using `send_mavlink`](https://dronekit-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/copter/guided_mode.html#guided-mode-how-to-send-commands)
[`message_factory` explanation](https://dronekit-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/automodule.html#dronekit.Vehicle.message_factory)
[Useful documents for listening on messages in dronekit](https://dronekit-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/mavlink_messages.html) I think this can help us in receiving data!

__Note:__ As I understood dronekit is more than pymavlink. its connection handler also automatically handles the listening to the Heartbeat message and many other messages like location and ... . it uses the mavutil.mavlink_connection inside but As I understood from its source code, it listens to the heartbeats as a ground control station!(I think these!)
So in RPI side you need to send heartbeat periodically with supported [MAV_TYPE](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_TYPE)! and use the pymavlink in there not the dronekit. this is a library for writing applications that communicate with autopilots( like mobile app connection to pixhawk and standard dialects like ardupilotmega.xml) and I think if you want to write mavlink code on drone or RPI you should/must use the pymavlink itself.
==For Now I think the pymavlink is enough and even better for funnywing custom connection between the RPI and my GCS application, but in future I will do this TODO:==

#### some explanation about how dronekit streams data and also for streams for custom data(I think not actually custom, just the ones from the ardupilot messages sets that are not officially or currently handled automatically)
as I understood it inherits from the `vehicle` class and in there creates listener and property(with the on_message and property decorators) for the supported message in the message set(i think!). Also for that message defines a class to hold the data. finally in the main code it adds an attribute listener for the object of custom vehicle class which calls a callback function on receiving that message type. finally I think we can get the data with `vehicle.property` like we get the position and ... .

In future I will work on using the dronekit for transmission of custom mavlink messages and dialects and for Now let's do the job! and I will ...

==Let's do the job ....!==


==__A little note:__== One thing that I've mentioned earlier is the fact that dronekit handles somethings automatically.
For example consider the case of `heartbeat` message. As I understood this message is a message which is used by standard/convention. I say that because using `pymavlink` I've sent some messages without sending/receiving the hearbeat message, So I can conclude that it is not a technical/software/hardware/... related necessity for communicating, But It can be a measure/notification to monitor the or to see if the connection is alive(I think and I mean by alive that the data stream continously transmit between systems). Actually I think the previous guys came into the idea that they need something showing the systems which their connections are alive and data transmits. Somewhere in the documentation I found a sentence saying that we should/must transmit heartbeat messages in the main loop or thread of the system to notify the other systems that the system works well and transmits data or its connection is alive, because if there was a problem in the system this thread could be stucked or ... (I think Not necesserily shows the failures because  maybe the minor threads have some problems and the main works well, But because the main tasks of the system are done by the main thread, so problem in the main thread, probabily implies a major problem!).
Based on what I've said the autopilots transmit heartbeat with periode of I think 1 Hz and dronekit connection using `connect` function handles this automatically(I think as a GCS app). So If we use the pymavlink I think we should do this by ourselves. ==Anyway this could be a nice thing to have in your communication system and you can implement it when your setup becomes more compelete. For now let's do the job!==
