I have searched too much for using MAVSDK to send custom mavlink messages generated for funnywing project, but I could not find anything at the moment!!!!
I think the MAVSDK is just for high-level things that every bussinessman needs for creating a beautiful App which shows delivery things, but it lacks some advanced features for creating test products and researchs, like sending custom mavlink commands as we have in the dronekit api by `send_mavlink()` function! Maybe their targeted user community are those bussinessman and not researchers!

So at the moment I will stop to work on usage of MAVSDK but in future I will check this out! So let's do the job with pymavlink and dronekit api!

__TODO__:
- [ ] Ask about how we can send custom messages using MAVSDK python as we do that in pymavlink and Dronekit(`send_mavlink`) in [this github issue](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Python/issues/506) or some stackoverflow question!
